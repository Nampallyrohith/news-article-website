<h4>Functionality</h4> <br>
Your application should have the following features:
Home Screen: This should display a list of articles in a format similar to traditional newspapers. Consider using columns, headlines, subheadings, and thumbnail images.
Article Detail Screen: Upon clicking an article on the Home Screen, the app should navigate to a detailed article view. This screen should display the article's title, content, author, and publication date.
Styling: Use Bootstrap components and custom styling to achieve a look reminiscent of a classic newspaper. Pay attention to typography, spacing, and layout.
Navigation: Implement routing between the Home Screen and the Article Detail Screen using React Router.

Important Note <br>

use this for date and time <br> - const currentDate = new Date().toLocaleDateString(); <br> - const currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
